## How to use it

1. Clone this repo

2. In Chrome, visit [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/)

3. Toggle on "Developer mode" in the upper right

4. Click "Load unpacked"

5. Point at this source code folder

Now when you browse a private GitHub repo, the header bar will appear in red color.
